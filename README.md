dlint
=====

*dlint* is a linter for D code.

Unlike the leading D linting project, [DScanner](https://github.com/dlang-community/D-Scanner), *dlint* uses the DMD compiler front-end to parse D code. It is therefore able to perform some checks which are infeasible to accurately implement in DScanner.
